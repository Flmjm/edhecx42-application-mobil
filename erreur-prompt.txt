AsyncStorage. Auth state will default to memory persistence and will not
persist between sessions. In order to persist auth state, install the package
"@react-native-async-storage/async-storage" and provide it to
initializeAuth:

import { initializeAuth, getReactNativePersistence } from 'firebase/auth';
import ReactNativeAsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
const auth = initializeAuth(app, {
  persistence: getReactNativePersistence(ReactNativeAsyncStorage)
