The migrations folder is intended to contain migration files generated by Prisma when you run the migration commands. Since these files are created automatically by Prisma based on changes to your schema, the folder itself does not contain any specific content that can be predefined. 

Therefore, the contents of the file /my-node-backend/my-node-backend/prisma/migrations will be intentionally left blank.
